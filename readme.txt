Gladiator Online (http://www.GladiatorOnline.se)

A webpage for sorting tournament matches. Define how many players, 
and how many pools that players should consist of. Then when you sort it, it will try sort players so that everyone 
in the pool will get to face each other. But it will also try to make sure that no one has to go two matches in a 
row so they have a chance to rest in between matches.
